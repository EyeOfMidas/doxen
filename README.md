A very lightweight forum implementation.

### Quickstart

To set up your own instance of doxen, just copy the **setup/apache2_doxen** vhost definition to your apache2 configuration.

For the database, create a user with read, write and update on an appropriate database. The default db name is "doxen". The mysql database setup script is in **setup/mysql_db.sql" and will create the required tables.
